## 🎯 What is Spinlock?

Spinlock enables systematic exploration of neural operator parameter spaces to build behavioral representations for operator reasoning. Rather than studying individual operators in isolation, Spinlock treats the entire operator space as a structured domain for learning and discovery.

### Core Capabilities

- **Stratified Low-Discrepancy Sampling** - Sobol sequences with Owen scrambling for efficient parameter space exploration, ensuring diverse yet systematic coverage
- **Stochastic Rollout Generation** - 500+ timestep trajectories with multiple realizations per operator, capturing behavioral variability and dynamics
- **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction** - Four complementary feature families (IC+NOP+SDF+TD) jointly capturing operator behavior from different perspectives
- **Hierarchical VQ-VAE Tokenization** - Automatic category discovery via clustering, creating discrete behavioral vocabularies for operator reasoning

### Design Philosophy

Spinlock is built on the principle that **operators have behaviors, and behaviors can be learned**. By generating diverse operator samples, extracting rich behavioral features, and tokenizing these features into discrete vocabularies, Spinlock provides the foundation for systems that can reason about, generate, and compose dynamical behaviors—essential capabilities for building Neural Operator Agents.

## 🧠 Neural Operator Agents (NOA)

Spinlock provides the data infrastructure for building **Neural Operator Agents**—systems that learn to understand, generate, and reason about dynamical behaviors through hierarchical behavioral tokenization.

### The NOA Vision: From Data to Meta-Cognition

**Phase 0: Foundation** (✅ Current)
- Stratified neural operator datasets with diverse parameter coverage
- Multi-modal feature extraction (IC, NOP, SDF, TD)
- Hierarchical VQ-VAE tokenization of behavioral patterns

**Phase 1: Single-Step Agent Mapping** (🔄 In Development)
- Learn mappings from behavioral tokens → operator parameters + initial conditions
- Hybrid loss: token reconstruction + feature-space matching

**Phase 2: Multi-Observation Context** (📋 Planned)
- Transformer-based temporal encoder for operator sequences
- Capture higher-order dependencies and temporal correlations

**Phase 3: Exploration & Agency** (📋 Planned)
- Self-directed discovery of novel operators and initial conditions
- Meta-dynamical cognitive memory for autonomous exploration

**Phase 4: Meta-Cognition & Self-Awareness** (📋 Planned)
- Self-referential modeling: agent observes its own generative behavior
- Functional introspection through learned internal models

**Phase 5: Scientific Discovery** (📋 Planned)
- Autonomous hypothesis generation and testing
- Emergent understanding of operator families and dynamical regimes

**Current Status:** Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 in development

See [docs/noa-roadmap.md](docs/noa-roadmap.md) for detailed architecture and implementation plan.

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Neural Operator Generation
- **Sobol-stratified parameter sampling** - Low-discrepancy sequences ensure uniform parameter space coverage
- **CNN operator construction** - Build neural operators from parameter vectors
- **Stochastic rollout generation** - 500 timesteps × 3 realizations capturing behavioral variability

#### 2. Feature Extraction (4 Complementary Families)
- **IC** (Initial Condition): 42D hybrid features
  - 14 manual features: spatial, spectral, information-theoretic, morphological
  - 28 CNN embeddings: ResNet-3 encoder for learned spatial patterns
- **NOP** (Neural Operator Parameters): 21D architectural/stochastic/evolution features
  - Direct parameter space features (architecture, stochastic, operator, evolution, stratification)
- **SDF** (Summary Descriptor Features): 420-520D aggregated behavioral statistics
  - Spatial, spectral, temporal, cross-channel, causality, invariant drift, operator sensitivity
- **TD** (Temporal Dynamics): Full temporal resolution trajectories [N,M,T,D]
  - Preserves time-series structure for sequential modeling

#### 3. VQ-VAE Tokenization
- **Joint training across all feature families** (IC+NOP+SDF+TD)
- **Automatic category discovery** via hierarchical clustering (~8-15 categories)
- **Multi-level discrete latent space** (coarse → medium → fine)
- **Feature cleaning** - NaN removal, variance filtering, deduplication, outlier capping

#### 4. Behavioral Vocabulary
- **Discrete tokens** representing operator behavioral patterns
- **Category-specific embeddings** preserving multi-modal structure
- **Foundation for transformer-based agent reasoning** (Phase 2+)

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed system design.

## 📊 Feature Families

Spinlock extracts **4 complementary feature families** that jointly capture neural operator behavior from different perspectives:

| Family | Dimensions | Captures | Granularity |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **IC** | 42D | Initial condition characteristics (spatial, spectral, information, morphology) | Per-realization |
| **NOP** | 21D | Operator parameters (architecture, stochastic, evolution) | Per-operator |
| **SDF** | 420-520D | Aggregated behavioral statistics (spatial, spectral, temporal, causality) | Scalar summaries |
| **TD** | Variable | Full temporal trajectories preserving time-series structure | Per-timestep |

### Joint Training

The VQ-VAE jointly trains on all 4 families simultaneously, learning unified representations that span:
- **IC**: How initial conditions influence operator dynamics
- **NOP**: How architectural choices determine behavioral regimes
- **SDF**: Statistical signatures of emergent patterns
- **TD**: Temporal evolution and regime transitions

This multi-modal training enables the model to discover behavioral categories that integrate structural, dynamical, and temporal characteristics—essential for NOA systems that reason about operator behavior.

See [docs/features/](docs/features/) for detailed feature definitions and extraction methods.
